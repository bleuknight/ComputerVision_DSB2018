## Preprocessing Pipeline for the Data Science Bowl 2018
### The first notebook creates an image classifier from all images in the dataset as well as external images in order to acquire information about whether or not the test images need downstream preprocessing.

### The second notebook creates black and white images from Hematoxylin and Eosin stained images. Hopefully our model will perform better if it only has to deal with one type of image.
